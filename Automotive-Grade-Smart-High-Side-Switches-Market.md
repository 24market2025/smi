<h1>Automotive Grade Smart High Side Switches Market</h1>
Automotive Grade Smart High Side Switches Market Overview
High side switches refer to semiconductor switches used to control the flow of current between the load and ground (GND). Compared to traditional low side switches, high side switches can provide better load control and achieve safer power outage operations in high-voltage systems. In new energy vehicles such as electric vehicles and hybrid vehicles, high side switching technology is particularly crucial due to the fact that the operating voltage is usually much higher than traditional vehicles. With the upgrading of electronic and electrical architecture in the automotive industry, the process of electrification, intelligence, and networking is accelerating. In vehicle electronic systems have put forward higher demands for online OTA upgrades and online fault diagnosis. Therefore, the demand for high edge intelligent switch chips in applications such as in vehicle central control, ADAS, BMS, body control modules, and domain controllers is also increasing.
