<h1>Global CPU Sockets Market</h1>
CPU Sockets Market Overview
A CPU socket is a physical interface on a motherboard that allows a central processing unit (CPU) to be securely connected to the computer's electrical system. It provides the necessary connections for data transfer, power supply, and cooling, enabling the CPU to communicate with other components of the system. CPU sockets are designed to fit specific CPU architectures and ensure compatibility between the processor and the motherboard.

CPU sockets give computer the power it needs to communicate with other parts of system hardware. It works the same way as a light socket. It provides power and electrical connections to a compatible light bulb for it to work.
The three main socket types used today are land grid array (LGA), pin grid array (PGA), and ball grid array (BGA).

The market is dominated by Intel and AMD.
