<h1>Hollow Core Fiber Market</h1>
Hollow Core Fiber Market Overview
Hollow core fiber is a type of optical fiber that has a hollow core instead of a solid core. It is made by creating a periodic array of air holes that run along the length of the fiber, which causes light to be guided through the hollow core. Hollow core fiber has been developed for the first time since 1999.
