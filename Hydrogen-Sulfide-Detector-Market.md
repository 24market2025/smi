<h1>Hydrogen Sulfide Detector Market</h1>
Hydrogen Sulfide Detector Market Overview
Hydrogen Sulfide (H2S) is a colorless toxic gas with an odor like rotten eggs. This gas naturally occurs during the chemical breakdown of organic compounds in the absence of Oxygen. H2S is highly toxic and can cause adverse effects on the human body as low as 2ppm and can be fatal at levels as low as 100ppm with prolonged exposure. H2S sensors detect dangerous levels of hydrogen sulfide gas to ensure a safe working environment. Typical areas where gas sensing, detection.
