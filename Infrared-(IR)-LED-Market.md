<h1>Infrared (IR) LED Market</h1>
Infrared (IR) LED Market Overview
Infrared rays are electromagnetic radiations in the nonvisible spectrum of white light, which range from 1300 to 1700 nm. Infrared light emitting diode (IR LED) is a solid-state lighting (SSL) device, which emits light in the infrared range. It spreads the light on a vast area rather than concentrating it or in other words IR LEDs have a wide field of view. These LEDs find their extensive use in security and surveillance cameras, along with automated driving vehicles.
