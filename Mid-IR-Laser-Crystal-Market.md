<h1>Mid-IR Laser Crystal Market</h1>
Mid-IR Laser Crystal Market Overview
For mid-infrared (and partly also terahertz) generation, one requires crystal materials with a transparency range extending far into the infrared spectral region. The most important of these media are zinc germanium diphosphide (ZGP, ZnGeP2), silver gallium sulfide and selenide (AgGaS2 and AgGaSe2), gallium selenide (GaSe), and cadmium selenide (CdSe). Gallium arsenide (GaAs) has also become useful for mid-infrared applications, since it is possible to obtain quasi-phase matching in orientation-patterned GaAs. There are also various barium-based crystal materials such as BaGa4S7, BaGa4Se7, BaGa2GeS6 and BaGa2GeSe6.

This report provides a deep insight into the global Mid-IR Laser Crystal market covering all its essential aspects. This ranges from a macro overview of the market to micro details of the market size, competitive landscape, development trend, niche market, key market drivers and challenges, SWOT analysis, value chain analysis, etc.
