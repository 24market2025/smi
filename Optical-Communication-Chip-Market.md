<h1>Optical Communication Chip Market</h1>
Optical Communication Chip Market Overview
In optical devices, optical chips are used for the conversion of photoelectric signals. According to the type of light emission, it is divided into surface emission and side emission. Among them, surface-emitting lasers are mainly VCSEL (vertical cavity surface-emitting lasers); there are many types of edge-emitting lasers, including FP (Fabry PeÃÅrot, Fabry-Perot laser), DFB (Distributed Feedback Laser, distributed feedback laser) Lasers) and EML (Electroabsorption Modulated Laser), traditional FP laser chips have gradually narrowed their applications in the field of optical communication due to large losses and short transmission distances. There are three main types of core laser chips: DFB and EML And VCSEL.
