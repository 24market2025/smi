<h1>Oven Controlled Quartz Crystal Oscillators (OCXOs) Market</h1>
Oven Controlled Quartz Crystal Oscillators (OCXOs) Market Overview
The OCXO is an oscillator which is temperature controlled (ovenized crystal controlled oscillator). This type of oscillator has a temperature controlling circuit to maintain the crystal and key components at a constant temperature. OCXOs are typically used when temperature stabilities on the order of ±1 x 10-8 or better are required. While this type of oscillator has a tenfold improvement over a TCXO for temperature stability, the OCXO tends to be higher in price and consumes more power. Typical power at +25°C ambient is 1.5 Watts to 2.0 Watts in a steady state condition.
