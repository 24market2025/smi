<h1>Semiconductor Molding Systems Market</h1>
Semiconductor Molding Systems Market Overview
The semiconductor production process consists of wafer manufacturing, wafer testing, chip packaging and testing. Packaging refers to cutting, wire bonding, molding, trim & forming the wafer after production and processing, so that the integrated circuit can achieve electrical and signal connections with external devices while providing physical and chemical protection for the integrated circuit. Molding refers to a plastic molding process in which packaging materials such as epoxy resin mixture are injected into the mold cavity at a certain temperature and pressure, and the devices that need to be protected, such as chips, are wrapped in the plastic, and then solidified into a whole body. The roles of Molding products in semiconductor packaging are as follows: 1. Protective effect. Exposed semiconductor chips will not fail under strict environmental control, but the daily environment does not have the required environmental control conditions at all, so the chips need to be protected by packaging. 2. Supporting effect. The support has two functions. One is to support the chip, which is to fix the chip to facilitate circuit connection. The other is to form a certain shape to support the entire device after the packaging is completed, making the entire device less likely to be damaged. 3. Connection function. The function of the connection is to connect the electrodes of the chip to the external circuit, the pin is used to connect the external circuit, and the gold wire connects the pin to the circuit of the chip. The carrier stage is used to carry the chip, the epoxy resin adhesive is used to stick the chip on the carrier stage, the pins are used to support the entire device, and the plastic package plays a role in fixing and protecting it. 4. Ensure reliability. Any packaging needs to have a certain degree of reliability, which is the most important metric in the entire packaging process.
