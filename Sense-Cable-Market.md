<h1>Sense Cable Market</h1>
Sense Cable Market Overview
The sense cable is a kind of signal transmission tool. Generally, the signal transmitted by the sensor is very weak. In order to avoid signal interference, the signal cable has a shielding layer outside, and the shielding layer of the wrapped conductor is generally a conductive cloth, a braided copper mesh or a copper pouch (Aluminum), the shielding layer needs to be grounded, and external interference signals can be introduced into the earth by this layer to avoid interference signals entering the inner conductor interference and reduce the loss of transmission signals.
